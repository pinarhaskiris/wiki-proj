# wiki-proj
A Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia. Where users can create, edit or search entries and get random entries.

I did this project to practice Django. (Markdown2 was also used alongside with HTML and CSS.)

I didn't use Django models so this a just front-end site.

**This is one of the projects I did for 'CS50W - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript' course given by Harvard University on edX.**
